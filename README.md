## Some Answers

Q: **Why are there unused Assets in the Project?**
A:  "Never touch a running System" - I forgot to remove some Assets earlier and I don't want to risk breaking the Project by accident. I think thats some additional drawback working alone. 

Q: **Are the scripts copies from the Asset store?**
A: No, I had a goal to script everything on my own for learning purposes - I used many different Tutorials on different plattforms like Unity-Forums, Stack Overflow, Youtube including two Udemy courses I bought to dive deeper into the topic. 
Only  the collision detedtion logic found in Character Movement was entirely adapted from a Character pack.

Q: **Skins, Coins, shop mechanic is missing**
A: I had to adapt the scope of my game, since my teambuddy left me right before *Playtesting Session 1* without commiting anything. So I had to cut out some ideas to get the Project done.
